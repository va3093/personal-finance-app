# Personal Finance App

This is an experimental project with the following aims:

1. **Model income and expenses**: Advise on how much to save each month in order to make sure you can affort things you want to buy in the future like a house, a car or even "small" things like a phone.
2. **Create plan for financial independence**: Understand what is required to become financially independent at a given age. I define financial independence as not having to work for money.
3. **Pick the best investment strategies**: From a given set of investments, run simulations that will pick investments that optimise for your financial independence age.

## Tech stack

This is a rust project and will serve as the api for the web front end.
